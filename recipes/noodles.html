        <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese,</p>
        <p>salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice</p>
        <p>could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak,</p>
        <p>chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredient</strong></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>â…“ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain and return pasta to pot. Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
