        <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese,</p>
        <p>salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice</p>
        <p>could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak,</p>
        <p>chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
